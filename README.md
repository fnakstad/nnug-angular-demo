NNUG Angular.js Demo
====================

This demo of Angular.js was intended to accompany a talk at NNUG in Trondheim, and shows off some basic Angular concepts. To run the example you need to do the following:

1. [Install Node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Open a shell and navigate to the project root
3. Run `bower install`, then `npm install` to get dependencies
4. Start up the server with `node server.js`
